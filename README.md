# Project-Euler

Project Euler is based on a website with the same name, projecteuler.net. It is a website that contains many mathematical problems that can solved
using code written in any language of the solvers choice. This repository is just the publishing of my solutions with regards to the problems introduced 
in project euler. Feel free to contact me @cereal_chickiller on instagram for discussions about my solutions.
